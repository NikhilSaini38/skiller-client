battery: Battery tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Battery test.
This test reports which (if any) batteries there are in the system. In addition,
for charging or discharging batteries, the test validates that the reported
'current capacity' properly increments/decrements in line with the charge
/discharge state. This test also stresses the battery state reporting codepath
in the ACPI BIOS, and any warnings given by the ACPI interpreter will be
reported.
Found 1 batteries.
Test battery 'BAT1'.
